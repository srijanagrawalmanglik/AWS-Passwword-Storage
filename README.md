Passwords are fundamental for information security. They are used as a
first-line defense in securing almost all our electronic information,
networks, servers, devices, accounts, databases, files, and more. Most of
us now have a multitude of passwords we need to somehow keep track of
and remember.
▪ AWS-Integrated Password Storage System is a program that houses
all your passwords and other information in one convenient location
with one master password.
▪ In the AWS-Integrated Password Storage System, we are
implementing the password management system in the form of a
web application using AWS thus making the storage of the data and
the database fully secure.
▪ This application will allow the users to store various passwords along
with other login details such as their email id. To protect the details of
the user from being accessed without proper authorization, an
authentication system will be set up and which can be accessed by
the user after authentication.
Furthermore, we have discussed the methods used and the results
achieved in our project till now and future improvements.

Our application will help users to keep track of all the passwords that
users need to help protect their online accounts. It will store those login
credentials in its database. There are different kinds of password
managers, but they are not very user-friendly and it might be hard for
people to understand how to save their passwords properly. Wehave tried
to make it easier for users to be able to use the password manager and
retrieve their passwords when they need them. Also, the security
problems are there in old password managers, or the security methods
they use are very old and take too much time and memory to process. We
have tried using safer methods of password hashing in orderto save both
time and memory of the user’s system in order to operate seamlessly.
